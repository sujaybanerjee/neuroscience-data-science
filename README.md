This app is designed to give a background of the prefrontal cortex, discuss how neural data is measured, and investigate and analyze a real data set. 
The graphs made from the data set are interactive to allow the user to visualize the figures in different ways. 
The data set is taken from a published article in Nature Neuroscience called 'Behavior-dependent short-term assembly dynamics in the medial prefrontal cortex.' 
We specifically looked into the spike time data of three different rats and the times of the trials that were conducted.
